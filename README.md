## _Inspiration_

Computer Science students at CUNY colleges, specifically Medgar Evers College, Staten Island College, John Jay College and Brooklyn College have always had access to their Cumulative GPA but not their Major GPA . 
We wanted to solve this problem by allowing these students to get their Major GPA. 

## _What it Does_

The application allows CS students at the specific colleges to respond to a prompt that first asks them to upload their unofficial transcript, then it asks them for a selection of the college they attend. The program then shows the current major GPA for the student. 

## _How We built it_

We built our application using strictly python to handle all the importing of transcripts, python built in OCR for extracting the pdf transcript and the calculation of the major GPA.    

## _Challenges We ran Into_

Our biggest challenge was to get all the different major courses for CS students for all of the four colleges.  

## _Accomplishments that We are Proud Of_

We are proud that the application was able to successfully help CS students at the four CUNY colleges to effortlessly upload and calculate their Major GPA with a simple but efficient GUI.  


## _What's next for CS-GPA-From-PDF_

The application will be expanded to calculate all CS students' Major GPA at all CUNY schools.
