## _Inspiration_

Computer Science students at CUNY colleges, specifically Medgar Evers College, Staten Island College, John Jay College and Brooklyn College have always had access to their Cumulative GPA but not their Major GPA . 
We wanted to solve this problem by allowing these students to get their Major GPA. 

## _What it Does_

The application allows CS students at the specific colleges to respond to a prompt that first asks them to upload their unofficial transcript, then it asks them for a selection of the college they attend. The program then shows the current major GPA for the student. 

## _How We built it_

We built our application using strictly python to handle all the importing of transcripts, python built in OCR for extracting the pdf transcript and the calculation of the major GPA.    

## _Installation_

pip install requirements.txt

## _How to run_

python3 main.py
